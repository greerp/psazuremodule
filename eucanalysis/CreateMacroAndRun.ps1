﻿<#

    This is an example of inserting some code into a Excel code module and then executing that code
    by launching the macro - The function below loads the code (also below but nornally in a separate file) 
    which is then executed when by calling the Run method on the Application object

        function UnlockVbaProject($objExcel, $wbToUnlock) {

            # Load the unlock macro code from a separate .ps1
            $code = . .\UnlockVbaMacro.ps1

            $vbaWb = $objExcel.WorkBooks.Add()
            $module = $vbaWb.VBProject.VBComponents.Add(1)
            $module.CodeModule.AddFromString($code)

            #Unlock VBA
            $wbToUnlock.Activate
            $macro= $vbaWb.Name + "!Unprotect"
            $objExcel.Application.Run($macro)

            $vbaWb.Close($false)


            return
        }
